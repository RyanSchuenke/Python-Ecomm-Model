# Python-Ecomm-Model

This project was for an object-oriented coding class and is based on my own work experience at a grocery store.  

Custom classes for an ordered list and items to be placed inside of it.  The items represent ecommerce orders for a grocery store and the ordered list represents the order in which the orders would be completed.  The sorting is done based on multiple levels of priority and is intended to minimize wait times.  

A model of a typical workplace day uses these classes to represent the completion of orders and find the amount of time orders are completed late by.  Other test cases are included to compare methods of ordering the ecommerce orders into the list.
